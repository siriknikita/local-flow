After finishing your implementation of changes, if the backend/app runs correctly/compiles successfully, update the README.md file to reflect the changes.

## Documentation Guidelines

1. **Only update if working**: Only update README.md if you have verified that:
   - The backend runs correctly, OR
   - The app compiles successfully

2. **Focus on features, not fixes**:
   - Document **what** the feature is
   - Document **how** it works (both high-level and technical details)
   - Document **when** it works (use cases, conditions)
   - **DO NOT** explain why fixes worked or what problems were solved

3. **Update mermaid diagrams**: If any mermaid diagrams exist in README.md or docs/, update them to reflect:
   - Actual system changes
   - Current architecture
   - Data flow
   - Project structure

4. **Keep it accurate**: Ensure all paths, commands, and examples in README.md match the current project structure.

5. **Update relevant sections**:
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Configuration references
   - Script usage
