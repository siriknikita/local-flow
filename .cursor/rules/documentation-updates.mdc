After finishing your implementation of changes, if the backend/app runs correctly/compiles successfully, update documentation in the `docs/` folder to reflect the changes.

## Documentation Guidelines

1. **Only update if working**: Only update documentation if you have verified that:
   - The backend runs correctly, OR
   - The app compiles successfully

2. **Focus on features, not fixes**:
   - Document **what** the feature is (high-level description)
   - Document **how** it works (technical implementation details)
   - Document **when** it works (use cases, conditions, prerequisites)
   - **DO NOT** explain why fixes worked or what problems were solved

3. **Update mermaid diagrams**: If any mermaid diagrams exist in documentation, update them to reflect:
   - Actual system changes
   - Current architecture
   - Data flow
   - Component interactions
   - Project structure

4. **Documentation levels**:
   - **High-level**: User-facing features, use cases, benefits
   - **Technical**: Implementation details, APIs, data structures, algorithms

5. **Keep it accurate**: Ensure all documentation matches the current codebase and project structure.

6. **Create new docs if needed**: If implementing a significant new feature, create appropriate documentation files in `docs/` folder.
